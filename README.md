# 470HonorsContract

This project is in partial fullfilment of an honors contract with Dr. Chris Handy for ECON 470 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The goal of the analysis is to better understand the impact of state to state differences in minimum work hour requirements on employment rates. Additionally, this project will improve my familiarity with Stata and difference-in-difference methods.
